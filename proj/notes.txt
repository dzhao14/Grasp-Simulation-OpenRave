Heyo, I bet you forgot what's going on. I'm looking in my ~/openrave_stuff 
directory and there is just a bunch of junk haha. Well your openrave
simulation lives in ~/openrave_stuff/proj. As of right now the main script
is called test.py. In order to get stuff to run you must:
    source ~/rosTutorial/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
    roscore
    roslaunch gpd tutorial1.launch

--- 

Once you're re-adjusted check out Andrea's tutorial2 file located in: 
~/rosTutorial/catkin_ws/src/gpd/launch/tutorial2.launch
Insert an ipdb statement after idx is assigned. Then figure out what format the 
idx and dist are. See how they integrate into openrave movement.

In order to use Andreas's point cloud index filtering I need to use tutorial 2 and change the publisher in my script. I now need to publish to /cloud_indexed instead of /detect_grasps

After that I need investigate the format of the message of the filtered pointcloud (and indexes) -- starting on line 42 in ~/openrave_stuff/proj/filter.py
